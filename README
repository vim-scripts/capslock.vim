This plugin enables a software caps lock.  This is advantageous over a regular caps lock in that normal mode commands, other buffers, and other applications are unaffected.

The default mapping is <C-G>c but if you use this feature regularly, you will probably want a shorter one.  Simply map something to <Plug>CapsLockToggle and you are good to go.  The default behavior is to disable caps lock when leaving insert mode, but this is customizable too.

A couple of functions are provided for adding a caps lock indicator to the statusline.
